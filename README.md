# React Interview Questions and Answers

## Question 1: What is React?

### Answer:
React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by both Facebook and a community of individual developers. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render those components when the underlying data changes.

React follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is broken down into small, self-contained pieces called components. Each component manages its own state and can be composed together to build complex user interfaces. React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) for efficient updates and reconciliation with the actual DOM.

Example:
Here's a simple example of a React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a `HelloWorld` component that renders a `<div>` containing an `<h1>` element with the text "Hello, World!". This component can be rendered and displayed in the UI using other React components or the ReactDOM library.

## Question 2: What is the difference between library and framework? Why react is known as a library rather than a framework? 

### Answer: 
The terms "library" and "framework" are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct differences in terms of their functionality and usage.

**Library:**
- A library is a collection of pre-written code that provides specific functionality or features. It is designed to be reused by developers to simplify and speed up their development process.
- Libraries typically consist of a set of functions, classes, or modules that can be imported and used in a project.
- Libraries do not impose a specific structure or workflow on the developer and usually focus on solving a particular problem or providing a specific set of tools.
- Developers have more control over the flow of their application when using libraries, as they can choose which parts to use and integrate into their codebase.
- Examples of libraries include NumPy (for numerical computations in Python), jQuery (for DOM manipulation in JavaScript), and requests (for making HTTP requests in various programming languages).

**Framework:**
- A framework is a more comprehensive software platform that provides a foundation for building applications. It defines the structure, flow, and behavior of an application and offers a set of tools and libraries to simplify development.
- Frameworks often include a specific architecture or design pattern, along with predefined rules and conventions that developers must follow.
- Unlike libraries, frameworks are more opinionated and provide a holistic approach to application development.
- Developers build their applications within the framework's structure, leveraging the provided features and components.
- Examples of frameworks include Django (for web development in Python), Ruby on Rails (for web development in Ruby), and Angular (for building web applications in TypeScript).

**Now, let's address why React is often referred to as a library rather than a framework:**

**React:**
- React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces.
- React focuses on the view layer of an application, providing a declarative way to create reusable UI components.
- It allows developers to build complex user interfaces by composing smaller, reusable components.
- React itself does not provide a complete solution for building an entire application. It is often used in combination with other libraries or frameworks, such as React Router for routing or Redux for state management.
- React's flexibility and modular nature make it more suitable to be categorized as a library rather than a complete framework.

Although React provides some framework-like features, such as its component architecture and virtual DOM, it lacks some defining characteristics of a full-fledged framework. React does not enforce a specific application structure, routing mechanism, or state management solution, leaving these choices to the developer.

Overall, the distinction between a library and a framework lies in their scope and level of control they offer to developers. Libraries provide specific functionality to be used at the developer's discretion, while frameworks offer a more comprehensive structure and impose a particular way of building applications. React's focus on the view layer and its modular nature align more closely with the characteristics of a library.

## Question 3: What are React components?

### Answer:
React components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that manage their own state and define the UI structure and behavior. React components can be both functional and class-based.

**Functional Components:**
Functional components are JavaScript functions that return React elements. They are simpler and easier to understand compared to class components. Functional components are typically used for stateless or presentational components that don't have their own internal state or lifecycle methods.

Here's an example of a functional component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

In this example, the `Greeting` component is a functional component that accepts a `name` prop and displays a greeting message using that prop.

**Class Components:**
Class components are ES6 classes that extend the `React.Component` base class. They are used for components that require state management, lifecycle methods, and more complex logic.

Here's an example of a class component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  incrementCount() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.incrementCount()}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Counter` component is a class component that maintains its own state (`count`) and renders a paragraph showing the current count value. The `incrementCount` method is used to update the state when the button is clicked.

## Question 4: What is JSX in React?

### Answer:
JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension to JavaScript syntax that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files when working with React. JSX is a syntactic sugar provided by React to define the structure and content of React components in a more declarative and intuitive manner.

JSX looks similar to HTML but it is not actually HTML. It gets transpiled into regular JavaScript function calls by tools like Babel before being executed in the browser. JSX allows you to include JavaScript expressions within curly braces `{}` to dynamically generate content.

Here's an example of JSX:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

In this example, the `<h1>` element with the text "Hello, {props.name}!" is written in JSX. The `props.name` expression is a JavaScript expression within curly braces, allowing us to dynamically insert the value of the `name` prop.

JSX makes it easier to understand and visualize the structure of your UI components. It also allows you to use the full power of JavaScript to handle dynamic content and logic within your components.

## Question 5: What is the difference between state and props in React?

### Answer:
In React, both state and props are used to manage and pass data to components, but they have different purposes and behaviors.

**State:**
State is a built-in feature of React components that represents the mutable data managed by a component. It is an object that holds information specific to that component and can be updated over time. State is typically used for data that can change, such as user input, component interactions, or fetched data.

To initialize the state, you use the `constructor` method within a class component or the `useState` hook in functional components. State should be modified using the `setState` method in class components or the `useState` hook in functional components, as direct assignment will not trigger re-rendering.

Here's an example of state usage in a class component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  incrementCount() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.incrementCount()}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Counter` component has a state property called `count`, which is initialized to 0. The `incrementCount` method updates the `count` state when the button is clicked, and the updated value is displayed in the UI.

**Props:**
Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are read-only and should not be modified by the child component. Props are useful for providing configuration or dynamic data to a component, enabling the component to be reusable and customizable.

Props are passed to components in a similar way to HTML attributes. They can be any JavaScript value, including strings, numbers, objects, or even functions.

Here's an example of props usage:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Greeting name="John" />;
}
```

In this example, the `Greeting` component receives the `name` prop and displays a greeting message using that prop. The `App` component renders the `Greeting` component and provides the `name` prop with the value "John".

**To summarize, state is managed and updated internally by the component itself, while props are passed from parent components and remain unchanged by the receiving component. State is used for managing internal component data, whereas props are used for configuring and customizing child components.**

## Question 6: What are lifecycle methods in React?

### Answer:
Lifecycle methods are special methods provided by React that allow you to hook into different stages of a component's lifecycle. They provide an opportunity to perform certain actions at specific points in the component's existence, such as initialization, rendering, updating, and unmounting.

React components have three main phases in their lifecycle:

1. Mounting: This phase occurs when a component is being initialized and inserted into the DOM for the first time.

   - `constructor()`: The constructor method is called when a component is being created and allows you to initialize the component's state and bind event handlers.
   - `render()`: The render method is responsible for rendering the component's UI structure based on its props and state.
   - `componentDidMount()`: This method is invoked immediately after the component is mounted (i.e., inserted into the DOM). It is commonly used for initiating API calls, setting up subscriptions, or performing other initialization tasks that require access to the DOM.

2. Updating: This phase occurs when a component is being re-rendered due to changes in its props or state.

   - `render()`: The render method is called again to re-render the updated UI.
   - `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`: This method is invoked immediately after an update occurs. It is often used to perform side effects based on prop or state changes. You should check if the changes in props or state are relevant before performing any actions to avoid infinite update loops.

3. Unmounting: This phase occurs when a component is being removed from the DOM.

   - `componentWillUnmount()`: This method is invoked just before the component is unmounted and destroyed. It is commonly used for cleaning up any resources, event listeners, or subscriptions created during the component's lifecycle.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of some lifecycle methods:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class Timer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      time: 0
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(() => {
      this.setState(prevState => ({ time: prevState.time + 1 }));
    }, 1000);
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    if (prevState.time !== this.state.time) {
      console.log('Time updated:', this.state.time);
    }
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  render() {
    return <p>Time: {this.state.time}</p>;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Timer` component uses the `componentDidMount` method to start a timer when the component is mounted. The `componentDidUpdate` method is used to log the updated time value whenever it changes. The `componentWillUnmount` method is used to clear the timer before the component is unmounted.

**Note: React 17 introduced new lifecycle methods and deprecates some existing ones. If you're using React 16 or earlier, there are additional lifecycle methods like `componentWillMount` and `componentWillUpdate` that are still valid but have been deprecated in React 17 and later versions.**
